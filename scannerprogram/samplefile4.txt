After uploading a file with the 'callbackurl' header, the status of the webhook callback can
be checked using this endpoint. The status can be checked up to 12 hours after the file was
uploaded, any request sent after this time period will return not found. If calling the
endpoint without specifying a data_id, the status for all the
webhook callbacks in the last 12 hours will be sent back.

MetaDefender Cloud enables you to leverage our threat detection and prevention platform, MetaDefender.
For scanning files, hash lookups, and data sanitization we offer a community account exclusively for
demo purposes and personal use. For commercial use, please consult our Licensing page, online store or
contact our sales team to discuss which licensing model suits your needs.

A free integration with MetaDefender Cloud multi-scanning technology through the REST API is allowed only for:

Prototyping the integration with MetaDefender
Integration in your solution for demo purposes if and only if:
The integration in production will leverage a MetaDefender Core or MetaDefender Cloud commercial license
It's used only to demonstrate the product integration and will not save any data
Community users will be able to consume scan reports from 30+ anti-malware engines, but they are not
allowed to use the data provided by our platform in any way. For commercial use, the engine list will be
limited to the engines with which we have OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) agreements. Please consult
the list of available engines on our Licensing page.

For more information on how to use this REST API, please see our documentation below.
